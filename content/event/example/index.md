summary: Mei Yu Geng's research on GV-971
abstract: "The author thinks that the intestinal flora is a cause, and the target of gv-971 is the intestinal flora, but I always think that the change of intestinal flora is a result. Changes in gut microbiota may cause inflammation in the brain, leading to changes in cognitive function of the brain, but it is not necessarily Alzheimer's disease. At the same time, it may be that the inflammatory response caused by Alzheimer's disease further increases the inflammatory indicators in the body, not necessarily because of the role of intestinal flora. Combined with previous studies, I personally prefer that gv-971 will penetrate the blood-brain barrier, and the target is in the brain."
